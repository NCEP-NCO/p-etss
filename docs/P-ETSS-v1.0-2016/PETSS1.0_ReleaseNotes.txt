Release Notes:  P-ETSS v1.0.0

v1.0.0 - Initial implementation of Model
       - Code handoff #1 on February 22, 2017
       - Target Implementation date June 06, 2017
*Run ETSS 2.2 using 21 GFS ensemble members to create probabilities       
 a) Use equally weighted GFS ensebmle members
 b) Generate the following products:
    I) Grid products:
    * Surge and tide height above NAVD-88/AGL exceeded by 10% of the storms,
      hourly to hour 102 
    * Surge and tide height above NAVD-88/AGL exceeded by 10% of storms for 
      0-102 hours 
    * Surge and tide height above NAVD-88/AGL exceeded by 10% of storms in 6-hr
      incremental and cumulative groups to hour 102 (e.g. 0-6, 6-12, 12-18, ...
      96-102 and 0-6, 0-12, ... 0-102) 
    * Probability of surge and tide height greater than 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 feet above 
      NAVD-88/AGL, hourly to hour 102
    * Probability of surge and tide height greater than 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 feet above 
      NAVD-88/AGL, for 0-102 hours
    * Probability of surge and tide height greater than 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 feet above 
      NAVD-88/AGL, in 6-hr incremental and cumulative groups to hour 102 (e.g. 
      0-6, 6-12, 12-18, ... 6-102 and 0-6, 0-12, ... 0-102) 
    * Ensemble mean, maximum and minimum of surge and tide height above NAVD-88/
      AGL hourly to hour 102
    * Maximum over 0-102 hours of the ensemble (a) mean, (b) maximum and (c) 
      minimum of surge and tide height above NAVD-88/AGL
    * Ensemble mean, maximum and minimum of surge and tide height above NAVD-88/
      AGL in 6-hr incremental and cumulative groups to hour 102 (e.g. 0-6, 6-12, 
      12-18, ... 6-102 and 0-6, 0-12, ... 0-102
    II) Text products:
    * Surge only and surge and tide height above NAVD-88 exceeded by 10% and 90% 
      of the storms, hourly to hour 102 with model specific text file format for 
      a set of stations 
    * Ensemble mean, maximum and minimum of surge only and surge and tide height 
      above NAVD-88, hourly to hour 102 with model specific text file format for 
      a set of stations
           
*Input data: GFS 21 ensemble members wind data with 0.5 degree resolution
             3 days Hindacast (00,06,12 and 18 cycle) and current cycle Forecast

*Output:
         Output from 0 to 102 hours for gridded and text products


*Computational resource information:
         Number of CPU: 13 Nodes CPUs
         Memory: 2000 MB / CPU 
         Serial/Parallel runs: 13 Nodes CPUs independent scripts run in parallel
         Run Time: 39 minutes 
         Disk space required: 
             4.5 Gig for disseminated data
             560.0G per cycle for working folder folder
         How often: 4 cycle per day

*Dependencies: 
         (a) GRIB2 library, 

*Data retention for files in /com and /nwges under prod/para/test environments: 
         A few weeks

*Preimplementation testing requirements:
	 /dev/runPETSS.sh should be tested as part of this implementation

*Does this change require a 30-day evaluation? Likely
         The suggested evaluators: AK-HQ, AK-WFOs, MDL, OPC

*Include dissemination info
	 Where should this output be sent? NCEP NOMADS
	 Primary users: WFO and OPC
	 Archive to HPSS
	 Retention length: Few years
	 List which output files should be archived: 
         a) The GRIB files (petss.*t${cyc}z*m)
         b) Station output files (petss.*t${cyc}z*.txt)
